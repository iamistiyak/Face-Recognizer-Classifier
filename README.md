# Face-Recognizer-Classifier
**Functionality :** Upload the image and get the result.<br>
**Description:** I have created this web-app for classify and predict the person's identifications based on the thier image. I am mainly consider the visible eyes for images.
Because I have used training model of SVM who basically consider the facial patterns to predict the results.<br><br>

I have hosted this web-app on the **AWS server** and used EC-2 instance.<br>
Fronted: I have used **HTML, CSS, JS**<br>
Backend: I have used **Flask**<br>
web-server: I have used **ngin-x** receive the http request from the user and communucate with the model and return the values(reverse proxy).
